// Stage 2D Task 2: PICODECK recolours char sprites at blit time instead of
// baking a per-CharColors copy of the sprite sheet (Task 1 built the LUT
// mechanism in picodeck_sdl_impl.c; this wires callers to it). Any code that
// blits a Pic obtained from GetHeadPic/GetHeadPartPic/GetBodyPic/GetLegsPic/
// GetGunPic (or an ActorPics built from them) on PICODECK must bracket that
// blit between a set and a NULL clear -- see picodeck_charcolors.h for the full
// contract. Declared here (rather than separately in every .c that draws
// actor/head pics) since draw_actor.h is already the common include for all
// of them. Desktop keeps baking colours into the cache at
// PicManagerGetCharSprites time, so there is nothing to bracket there --
// the macro compiles away to nothing.
